<div>    <h4>My story</h4>
<p>I have always had a thing for travelling and testing my limits.
 When I was 19 years old, I moved 
  from Sweden and my big family of 10 & have been travelling since. Working in/travelling to various 
 countries have made me adaptable, independent, innovatie and organised.
  My curious nature led me to this path
  that I am currently on, a fun and challenging route to beceome
  a System developer.NET.
